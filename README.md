Zinema – Cinema Management Distributed Software System
There is a new cinema company on the market. Zinema is an up and coming business in need of help. It wants to have alleviated some of the pressure brought by starting in a declining market in Denmark. Its main purpose is to revive the Danish films in a new modern way. Some of the biggest maintenance costs go into the IT systems. Their software has an old interface that is costly to maintain and built in a way that no further features can be added to it. The customers and administrators have reported that it’s hard to handle and crashes often, without having saved what the user has done. This has resulted in a lot of money lost for the starting company.
The purpose of the project is to facilitate Zinema’s management process regarding: 
-Ticket Booking 
-Advertisement Placing
-Movie Screening
